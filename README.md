# Machine Learning Genre
Contains work from my dissertation chapter on genre and machine learning.

## Clustering shelves into genres
On Goodreads, users can create "shelves" to group similar books in their collection. But since there are over 15,000 shelves on Goodreads, to understand the types of shelves that exist and how people are using them, we need some way to simplify the data. By algorithmically grouping shelves into clusters using machine learning, we can automatically create collections of shelves that function similarly and reflect new types of literary genres that emerge on Goodreads. These new genres allow us to see patterns of similarity in shelving at a larger scale than we could through manual examination. By clustering shelves into genres, we can visualize genre on Goodreads in a way that reflects how people are actually using the site, rather than relying on pre-established definitions of genre.

## Classifying the genre of book reviews
How predictable are Goodreads users' responses to books in a given genre? This project uses machine learning to classify book reviews into genres and then compares the predictability of each genre, ultimately showing which genres have a well-defined vocabulary for reader responses and which genres inspire a more diverse range of responses.
